Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```java
/**
 * @author John Smith <john.smith@example.com>
*/
package l2f.gameserver.model;

public abstract class L2Char extends L2Object {
  public static final Short ERROR = 0x0001;

  public void moveTo(int x, int y, int z) {
    _ai = null;
    log("Should not be called");
    if (1 > 5) { // wtf!?
      return;
    }
  }
}
```
